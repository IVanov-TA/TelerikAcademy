Namespaces make it easier to come up with unique names.
Imagine how hard it would be to name your next child if
the name had to be unique across the face of the earth.
Restricting uniqueness to a more limited context,
like my set of children, simplifies things tremendously.
When I name my next child, my only consideration is that
I don't use the same name that I already used for one of
my other children.
